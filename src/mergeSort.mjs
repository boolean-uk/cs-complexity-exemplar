/*
Conceptual description: Recursive solution that continuously slices the array in half and saves the data on either side of the mid point. Itâ€™ll return when we there are 1 item arrays, then use the merge utility to start building the smaller arrays back into one large array, with every merge sorting them along the way.
Time Complexity: O(n log n)
Space Complexity:  Auxillary space complexity of O(1) (because of swap)
